# Heurly

## Installation

**_Prerequisites_**

To contribute to this project, you need to install a few items:

- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)(I recommend npm i -g pnpm)
- [wsl](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)  

To install the project and contribute, you need to take a few steps:
- git clone the `git@github.com:Heurly/Heurly.git` repo
- install the `pnpm i` dependencies
- add .env and .env.development.local to the project root (change the end-of-line sequence type to "LF")
- if you're on Windows, use wsl to make `./start-database.sh` (change the end-of-line type to "LF")
- `pnpm db:push` (change the end-of-line type to "LF")
- `pnpm db:seed`
- `pnpm dev`
- ü§åüèΩ Now the application is running on http://localhost:3000
- you can checkout the dev beta name branch and create your branch from it

## Deploy to preprod

To deploy to production, you need to update the prod database schema.

- Copy the contents of the .env.production.local prod file into .env and run the command `pnpm run db:push` (‚ö†Ô∏è be careful if prisma says "... delete data" make a copy of the data to migrate the data)
- PR to `beta` to deploy your code on https://beta.heurly.fr (don't forget to add a reviewer)
